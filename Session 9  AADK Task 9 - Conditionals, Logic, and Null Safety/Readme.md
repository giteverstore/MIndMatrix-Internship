# Session 9 - AADK Task 9: Conditionals, Logic and Null Safety

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Kotlin handles nullable data safely using conditionals and logic in Jetpack Compose.  
The application captures user input and prevents crashes using safe calls and validation.

---

## Objective

To build a stable UI that safely processes optional user inputs like email and age without causing runtime crashes.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- Null Safety using nullable types
- Safe conversion using `toIntOrNull()`
- Conditional logic using `when`
- Crash prevention
- Reactive UI using state

---

## Features

- Accepts optional email
- Accepts optional age
- Automatically categorizes age
- Displays fallback values safely

---

## Learning Outcome

- Understanding Kotlin null safety
- Using conditionals safely
- Building crash-resistant UI
- Connecting logic with Compose UI
